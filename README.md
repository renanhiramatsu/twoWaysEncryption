# twoWaysEncryption
This program decodes message files with two systems. The first one uses a
       a mapping system that mapps sequentially a letter from the alphabet to a
       letter in a cipher declared previously.
 
 The second uses a Caesar Cipher, it's a technique in which each character
 in plain text is replaced by a character some fixed number of positions
 down to it. (For this program, it shifts 4)


# What I used
-> Two header files to separate each method of decoding in which both inherits a pure virtual function from the base class

-> 1st Method: Mapping system

-> 2nd Method: Ceasar Cipher with 4 shifts
